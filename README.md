This is a mod for factorio that just adds a couple of RCON commands to export production stats

This is only useful to return the production stat numbers in a machine-readable format over an RCON connection. 
So this mod needs to be run on a server, and something else needs to run these commands over an RCON connection

The commands are:

/itemoutstats
- returns the total item output production stat numbers

/iteminstats
- returns the total item input production stat numbers

/fluidoutstats
- returns the total fluid output production stat numbers

/fluidinstats
- returns the total fluid production stat numbers
